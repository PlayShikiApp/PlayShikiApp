        A review is a genre of journalism and art criticism

        and thoughts and thusly inform other users about the quality of
        %{kind}. Also there are some unspoken rules that might help you
        to write a valuable review that you won't feel ashamed of once you
        decide to show it to other people.

        [*] Watching. First of all try to watch anime in high quality
        either with good dubbing or subtitles
        (the latter will give you an opportunity to evaluate seiyuus'
        performance that might become a revelation for those
        who are used to dubbed anime).

        [*] Introduction. Tell about the reasons why you have
        decided to write this review, what has inspired you to
        share your impressions. Or what part of anime or manga
        stands out from the rest. This is the pivot of your review.
        You can right away refer to the plot, direction,
        special effects or some general idea of producer or mangaka.

        [*] Peculiarities. You can describe best moments or characteristic
        features of anime or manga characters. Or else you can compare
        similar works, give your interpretation of the plot,
        criticize OST and much more.

        [*] Conclusion. Do you like this anime as a whole?
        Is it worth watching? Sum up your thoughts about this anime
        and evaluate the work of anime producer. Give your verdict.
