      interesting_how_audience_changed: >-
        It's quite interesting how audience changed over time:
        share of anime for kids was constantly declining while
        studios were producing more and more anime for teens and adults.
        Moreover, much OVA production now aims at those who can pay
        for it - with a high percentage of hentai titles.
        So a widespread belief that animes are just cartoons for kids
        is just a popular fallacy.

      mecha_almost_disappeared: >-
        Mecha has almost disappeared and adventures with fantasies
        are losing their popularity as well. On the other hand studios
        produce more and more mysteries and supernatural anime.
        We mentioned before that anime industry was becoming more
        adult oriented and we can see the proof of this statement here:
        the number of ecchi, harem, seinen and even josei animes is
        growing year by year.

        Nothing particularly interesting here. We can just trace
        how shares of different studios were changing during this period.
      all_minor_studios: >-
        All minor studios which have produced less than 10 anime titles
        during the last decade fall under the category 'Others'
        (and not shown by default).
